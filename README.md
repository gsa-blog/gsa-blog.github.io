## The Gene Set Analysis Blog

What? An entire blog only about Gene Set Analysis? What are you going to talk about?

GSA is one of the easiest tasks in bioinformatics. You just go to [DAVID](https://david.ncifcrf.gov/), [GSEA](http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp) or [Enrichr](https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/), and that's it. What do we have to discuss?

Well... There are many things to discuss...The enormous amount of new methods, the challenges that all GSA software face and the uncertainties they bring, the purely statistical issues, the application of GSA to non-mRNA datasets such as genomic ranges, ncRNAs, metabolomics, or metagenomics... And they are quite interesting discussions. And, given that GSA is the final step in the omics data analysis pipeline, they are quite important issues.

Therefore, let's do it. A Gene Set Analysis Blog. Starting now. Starting here.
