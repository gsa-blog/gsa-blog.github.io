## Announcement:

We are pleased to announce the introduction of **GSA-BenchmarKING**, a repository of GSA benchmarking tools:

[GSA-BenchmarKING homepage](https://gsa-central.github.io/benchmarKING.html)

**GSA-BenchmarKING** is a repository of apps/workflows/pipelines that allows benchmarking groups of GSA software in an easy and automated way. Currently, GSA-BenchmarKING contains jupyter notebooks with full workflows for benchmarking GSA methods, and shiny apps that allow benchmarking with the click of a few buttons.
