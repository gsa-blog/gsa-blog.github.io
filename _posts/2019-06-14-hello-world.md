_("It's a blog", somebody says... Eyes opening slowly... Blurry images...)_

Today we officially start the GSA Blog, and here is all what we have in mind: We want to share posts that feature discussions about both old and new Gene Set Analysis methods and tools, as well as some useful code. We believe such a discussion is fundamental for biomedical researchers to perform a correct functional interpretation of their omics data.

At this time point, we still don't know how is this place going to evolve, but those are our plans and we are excited about them.

_(Feeling that someone is holding me by my legs... Now I am upside down... Ouch!... Crying baby sounds...)_ Hey, that hurts! Is that how you are welcomed to this world?
