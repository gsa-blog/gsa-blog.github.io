**GSARefDB** is the most comprehensive database of GSA methods and tools. It is available as an excel file or as a shiny app, and contains information regarding the publication reference, website, software tool, and an index of its popularity (citation count). It is also a database of GSA reviews and of GSA papers applied to specific fields such as genomic regions, ncRNAs, and others.
