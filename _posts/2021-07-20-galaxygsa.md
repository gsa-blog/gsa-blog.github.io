## Announcement:
![Galaxy-GSA logo](/img/galaxygsa-logo-200x200.png)

We are pleased to announce the introduction of **Galaxy-GSA**, a group of GSA tools for different types of scenarios inside a Galaxy platform:

[Galaxy-GSA homepage](https://gsa-central.github.io/galaxy.html)

**Galaxy-GSA** is a group of GSA tools wrapped in a Galaxy platform. Each Galaxy-GSA tool gives visibility to all the software options, parameters, and help from the original packages, so the user can leverage Galaxyâ€™s simple and reproducible infrastructure to upload data, format data, choose parameters and options through a simple interface, and send results to the history to allow comparisons between different runs, communication between tools, and communication with all other Galaxy tools.
